Before I started studying Computer Science, I thought it was mostly just learning a programming language like C or Java to make programs that do stuff. Now, nearing the end of my college career, I now know that learning a programming language is just a small subset of the discipline. I would say that the most significant and important part of the discipline is learning how to approach and solve problems. Essentially, programmers are given problems and asked to find a solution using various tools. These tools include programming languages and libraries, abstract data types, algorithms, and design patterns. Design patterns are not exclusive to software engineering, but they are a perfect example of the mindset and method used by software engineers. They are essentially a guideline for solving common problems that people have made and shared over time. As a general example outside of software, a design pattern could be something like a door handle. A door handle solves the problem of opening a door, but has various different types and implementations that are situational and dependent on the environment, etc. 

I have only recently been introduced to the term "design pattern," but have realized that I have encountered them throughout my time studying Computer Science and writing code. The first one that comes to mind is the Observer design pattern, which is essentially an event handler. I encountered these in an Operating Systems course, where trap and interrupt events are essentially triggered when a change or event is "observed," which then triggers other things. Another design pattern that I have used before are Singletons, which are like global variables. I have used them in a Software Engineering course in which we built web applications that had multiple pages and classes that relied on data in databases. We handled this with Collections, where a variable was defined that held a collection of data and was exported and shared throughout the app. The term "design pattern" is just a way to label techniques that everyone who has a decent amount of coding experience has used at some point. They are useful in that their defined structure can help to identity aspects of a problem and possible solutions, bothof which can make a software engineer's life easier.
