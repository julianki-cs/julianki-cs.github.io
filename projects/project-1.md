During one summer break, I decided to finally try a somewhat well-known indie game called "Darkest Dungeon." The description states that "Darkest Dungeon is a challenging gothic roguelike turn-based RPG about the psychological stresses of adventuring." I think that quite a few people, including myself, see the description "challenging" as inadequate. The game is extremely punishing and unforgiving. There is very little room for error and the player is always in a disadvantageous position . I would guess that the majority of the people who played the game never finished it due to its difficulty.
